# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Project Description:

In this backend project I have created a data base to manage both my users and the items they have added to help this react project allow for multiple users. This is the basic verification of data for the users \_id and items to make sure the request are sent properly from user to server and then back.

## Technologies Description:

In this project I utilized eslint to format my code to help me set up the servers back end and make sure the file is formatted propperly. I also utilize postman to test and run my files to make sure my test come out correct. This project also uses mongoose to connect to and help me look up data that was sent from postman.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
